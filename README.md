# QR Scanner V3

### BackStory: 
So, there was an emergency request from a club to make a qr scanner app that can scan qr and then do R/W operations on the DB. And not on Firebase but on MongoDB as well. Deadline was in 3 hrs. This is the v3 of the same app with much more polished UI and code organization. Although the organization is not standarad as it has been conformed to the request of the user. This app scans the QR ticket and tells whether the person is registered on database or not. After the entry is confirmed, it also updates the database to avoid duplicates. It can be used by multiple persons in parallel for scanning distinct tickets.
